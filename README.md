# Playing-with-Tensorflow
Deep Neural Network with Tensorflow on the MNIST Fashion Dataset.

This is the first coding project I have ever attempted on my own that was not a problem from a book or online course.

Using skills learned from Coursera, I created an adjustable deep neural network model that accepts an array of data
representing individual 28 X 28 pixel images
